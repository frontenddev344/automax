The ultimate upgrade to suits the ARB Deluxe Bull bars. This is an easy drop in solution to your existing ARB fog light housing and will transform the little yellow puddles of lights to a high performance 5700K LED, with built in Day Time Running Light function. Our optics retain a very sharp lateral beam making these an excellent upgrade to penetrate below fog. Fog has a tendency to slightly hover above the tarmac and the idea behind the sharp lateral cut line is that the beam pushes underneath the fog to provide usable illumination, with a very wide coverage.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-video\">\n<div class=\"product-video-responsive\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7eDj50-6wQw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-shots\">\n<div class=\"product-shots-title\">\n<h3><strong>FACTORY FIT<\/strong>\u00a0LED FOG LIGHT<\/h3>\n<p>WITH DRL FUNCTION<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-shots-content\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stedi.com.au\/media\/wysiwyg\/ARB1\/ARB-Deluxe_1.jpg\" alt=\"Night\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-featured-information\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stedi.com.au\/media\/wysiwyg\/ARB1\/ARB-Deluxe-New.jpg\" alt=\"ARB Deluxe Fog Light LED Upgrade\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"product-featured-information-content\">\n<div class=\"item\">\n<div class=\"product-featured-text\">\n<p>LED &amp; DRL UPGRADE<\/p>\n<p>Stock is boring, which is why we created a beautifully engineered &amp; designed LED Fog Light upgrade with integrated Day-Time Running Light (DRL).
