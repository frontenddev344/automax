They are one of the thickest mandrel bent systems available in Australia \u2013 the thickness combined with 304 grade stainless steel produces a deep note and guarantees extreme strength.<\/p>\n<p>The exceptional quality of all Torqit exhaust systems is highlighted by our laser cut, stainless steel flanges which are welded internally and externally (no slip joints), heavy duty bracketry and high flow diesel specific cat convertors. The design of each individual system focuses on optimising power and torque which helps your vehicle to breathe better and last longer<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Time for a Performance Exhaust Upgrade?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2>Generally, there are two types of people looking for an exhaust upgrade.<\/h2>\n<p>You could be wanting to increase the power from your exhaust and receive a deep note. Alternatively, you may be looking to strengthen your touring and towing abilities. With Torqit, you can increase power and torque from your exhaust, while also reducing EGTs. What\u2019s more, the high quality steel ensures extreme strength even in the toughest terrains.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2><strong>Bolt Together Installation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2>All Torqit performance exhaust systems are completely \u2018Do It Yourself\u2019 bolt together.<\/h2>\n<p>This means you won\u2019t need a hoist to complete fitment. Rather, you have the option to fit the exhaust yourself or organise it to be fitted through your local stockist. Installation can take anywhere from 60 minutes to 3 hours. Fitment time depends on the exhaust system, if you have a hoist available and your experience with the appropriate tools.<\/p>\n<section id=\"strengths\" class=\"section-featured-list section-mb js-waypoint is-visible\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"featured-list\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__row\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__text a-fade-in-left\">\n<h2>Experience the Strengths of our Performance Exhausts<\/h2>\n<p>From the most durable materials to the simple setup process, explore the many advantages of a Torqit Performance Exhaust.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<ul class=\"featured-list__items\">\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--1\" data-number=\"1\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Thick stainless steel (1.7mm-2mm):<\/strong> This produces a deeper note with no cabin drone.
