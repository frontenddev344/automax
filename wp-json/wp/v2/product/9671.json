Go further, with more power.<\/p>\n<h5>Made in Australia, Torqit\u2019s Performance Headers\u00a0 increase exhaust flow for a significant boost in power, sound, and efficiency, while reducing back pressure and engine temperatures.<\/h5>\n<p>Torqit\u2019s Performance Headers are designed to build torque and horsepower throughout the entire rev-range and particularly in the mid to high RPM\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>With a new set of Performance Headers and a Torqit exhaust system, your vehicle will produce a deep, aggressive note. By helping the engine breathe more freely, Torqit\u2019s Headers reduce back pressure and improve exhaust flow, resulting in an overall boost in performance.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Ceramic Header Coating vs Header Wraps<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3>Torqit\u2019s Performance Headers are Fully Ceramic Coated. Here\u2019s Why\u2026<\/h3>\n<p>Finished with a tough ceramic coating rated to 1000 degrees, Torqit\u2019s Turbo X Ceramic Coating provides the most effective thermal barrier currently on the market. Designed for increased performance and durability, the coating extends the header lifespan by reducing temperatures and corrosion, without cracking or flaking.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, header wraps can result in costly damage when exposed to engine fluids and trapped moisture and heat. Ceramic coated headers are the number one option for long-term protection, performance, and maintaining a sleek finish.<\/p>\n<div class=\"image-content__text a-fade-in-up a-delay--1\">\n<div class=\"text-area\">\n<h3><strong>Performance Headers Vs Factory Manifolds<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Factory manifolds feed exhaust gases into one space- the most direct route out of the engine. This creates uneven engine pulses, as the flow from each cylinder has a different length to travel to the exhaust pipe. In contrast, Performance Headers have individual tubes for each cylinder, which improves engine efficiency by creating a more evenly balanced route for the exhaust gases to escape.<\/p>\n<p>Made from cast iron, factory manifolds are prone to cracking. To reduce this risk, the walls are extremely thick- which in turn shrinks the space for exhaust gases to flow through. Combined with uneven walls from the iron casting, factory manifolds increase turbulence and back pressure. This means less fresh air for combustion, and as a result less power. In comparison, the thinner walls of Torqit\u2019s Performance Headers provide a smooth, optimum diameter for unrestricted exhaust flow, without back pressure or stalling. This improves the air ratio, reduces engine strain, and increases overall vehicle performance.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3><strong>Do Headers Increase Performance?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Increased power and performance is usually the main goal when it comes to installing headers. By increasing exhaust flow and reducing back pressure, headers will provide noticeable power gains.<\/p>\n<p>Note installing headers on the Y62 Patrol deletes the primary cats, which can bring up 02 sensor warning lights. To avoid this, an ECU tune such as <a href=\"https:\/\/automax4x4.com\/product\/torqit-modulemap\/\">Torqit\u2019s ModuleMap solution<\/a> is required.<\/p>\n<div class=\"content-grid__col a-fade-in-up a-delay--2\">\n<div class=\"text-area\">\n<h3><strong>Will Headers Improve Fuel Economy?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For the majority of drivers, yes. The scavenging effect of headers improves the air to fuel mixture, meaning the engine can produce the same amount of power it did previously, but with less work. Fuel savings will be most noticeable when driving long distances at a constant speed, however this is dependent on driving behavior. If the main reason for installing headers is to enhance performance, the vehicle may be driven a little harder to enjoy the effects and as a result use more fuel.<\/p>\n<h3>The Difference Between Headers &amp; Extractors<\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s context, the answer is none- headers and extractors are just two different ways of describing the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>The old school term \u2018extractor\u2019 was originally used in Australia before the American term \u2018header\u2019 became the common name. So if you hear a mate talking about extractors, they simply haven\u2019t adopted the American lingo- similar to the words bonnet\/ hood and trunk\/ boot.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<section id=\"benefits\" class=\"section-featured-list section-mb js-waypoint is-visible\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"featured-list\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__row\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__text a-fade-in-left\">\n<h2>Performance Header Benefits<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s far more potential in your vehicle\u2019s engine than when it rolls off the factory floor. Explore the many advantages of Torqit\u2019s Performance Headers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<ul class=\"featured-list__items\">\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--1\" data-number=\"1\"><strong>Increased power and performance:<\/strong> Replacing restrictive factory manifolds with performance headers helps the engine expel gases faster and more efficiently. This means your vehicle will be breathing more freely with an overall boost in power and torque.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--2\" data-number=\"2\"><strong>Reduced Back pressure:<\/strong> A large, even pipe diameter and the long-tube design produces a &#8216;scavenging effect&#8217;. Through this process the exhaust gas in each engine cylinder is replaced with fresh air for the next cycle. It ensures the engine receives enough fresh air to work at full capacity, reducing back pressure and improving the efficiency of your vehicle.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--3\" data-number=\"3\"><strong>Improved Fuel Economy:<\/strong> Due to the efficient scavenging affect of headers, the engine does not need to work as hard to deliver the same power as previously. Dependent on driving behaviour, this can significantly improve fuel economy, particularly when cruising long distances.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--4\" data-number=\"4\"><strong>Lower Temperatures:<\/strong> Performance Headers cool down much faster than cast iron manifolds. Heat emissions are also reduced by Torqit&#8217;s durable ceramic coating, which in turn improves header lifespan, prevents rust, and maintains the sleek appearance.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--5\" data-number=\"5\"><strong>Enhanced note:<\/strong> Due to their less restrictive nature, performance headers will improve the tone of your exhaust note. This is even more noticeable when combined with a free-flowing performance exhaust, creating a deeper, sportier sound.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--6\" data-number=\"6\"><strong>Product Compatibility:<\/strong> Designed to fit alongside Torqit Performance Exhausts and high flow catalytic convertors, for maximum power, torque and performance.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--7\" data-number=\"7\"><strong>3 year product warranty:<\/strong> Each set of headers comes with a 3 year product warranty for peace of mind. Vehicle warranty will not necessarily be voided as Performance Headers have become common manifold replacements in the industry- confirm with vehicle manufacturer if uncertain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<h3>Torqit Performance Headers<\/h3>\n<p>Available for a wide range of vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Please request a quote for <strong>YOUR<\/strong> vehicle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":9669,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"product_cat":[820,37],"product_tag":[827,823],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" \/>\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"bingbot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/automax4x4.com\/product\/torqit-performace-headers\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"torqit Performance Headers - Automax 4x4\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Torqit Performance Headers Available for a wide range of vehicles.
