Made tough for tough Australian conditions.<\/h4>\n<div class=\"introduction-text__part introduction-text__part--right a-fade-in-up a-delay--1\">\n<div class=\"text-area\">\n<p>An airbox cleans and removes particles from the air before sending it on to the engine for combustion. By improving the quality of air reaching your engine, a tightly sealed airbox improves engine performance and offers potential fuel savings.<\/p>\n<p>Whether driving through dust, water or just pollutants around town, think of an airbox as a preventative measure against wear and tear on your engine. This means less maintenance for you, and a longer lifespan for your vehicle.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Why choose Stainless Steel<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>Every Torqit Airbox is manufactured from 304 grade stainless. Here\u2019s why\u2026<\/h4>\n<p>Over time, plastic airboxes lose their clamping ability due to expansion and contraction. As a result of poor sealing and cracks in the plastic, dust and water can enter the airbox and potentially damage your vehicles\u2019 engine, plus reduce power and fuel efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Manufactured from premium 304 grade stainless steel, Torqit\u2019s Airbox remains structurally rigid when exposed to heat and water. By preventing the warping that is common in plastic airboxes,\u00a0 Torqit\u2019s stainless steel airbox prevents loss of tension around the lid and remains tightly sealed in all conditions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<section id=\"advantages\" class=\"section-featured-list section-mb js-waypoint is-visible\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"featured-list\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__row\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__text a-fade-in-left\">\n<h3>Advantages of a Stainless Airbox<\/h3>\n<p>From the tapered lid to the larger than standard air filter, discover the many benefits of a Torqit Stainless Steel Airbox.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<ul class=\"featured-list__items\">\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--1\" data-number=\"1\"><strong>Enhanced performance:<\/strong> Maximise engine efficiency and access potential fuel savings by improving the volume and quality of air reaching the engine.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--2\" data-number=\"2\"><strong>Prevent engine damage and reduce maintenance:<\/strong> Prolong vehicle lifespan by preventing dust and water damage to vital engine components, and reduce the frequency of airbox filter changes.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--3\" data-number=\"3\"><strong>CNC bent and tapered lid:<\/strong> A raised and tapered lid provides increased air capacity and improved airflow, so that the entire surface area of the filter is utilised for maximum performance and filtration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<ul class=\"featured-list__items\">\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--1\" data-number=\"4\"><strong>Heavy Duty Construction:<\/strong> Thick, 304 grade stainless steel offers high structural rigidity, and resistance to rust, warping and extreme temperatures.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--2\" data-number=\"5\"><strong>Ryco Flat Paper Filter:<\/strong> Tried and tested in harsh Australian conditions, every airboxes houses a filter with a larger than standard surface area for maximum airflow and efficiency.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--3\" data-number=\"6\"><strong>Integrated Water Drainage:<\/strong> A Donaldson Water Evacuator provides drainage in the event any water enters the airbox.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--4\" data-number=\"7\"><strong>Choice of finish:<\/strong> Available in a brushed stainless steel finish, or a powder coated satin black.<\/li>\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--5\" data-number=\"8\"><strong>5 year product warranty:<\/strong> A Torqit airbox comes with a 5 year warranty for peace of mind.
