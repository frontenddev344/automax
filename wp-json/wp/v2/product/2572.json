The manufacturing process involves a custom jig attached to a robot arm inserting the 88 alloy teeth in the correct orientation into special sockets in the injection mould, then over-moulding them into the body of the track, ensuring that the Nylon material conforms closely to the thread of each tooth for a super secure fit, virtually eliminating the risk of a tooth unwinding from the body of the track. All 88 alloy teeth are hard-anodised to protect against corrosion in harsh, salt water or muddy environments.<\/li>\n<li>As the alloy is significantly harder and more durable than the rubber compound found in tyres and also more resistant to wear from a spinning tyre than any polymer available today, you can expect faster, more secure engagement with the tyre&#8217;s tread pattern; which not only makes\u00a0<strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0the most-durable recovery track on the market, but also the fastest.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0is also easily repairable in the field. If a tooth gets damaged, simply flip the board over and use a T-50 Torx bit to remove and replace the damaged tooth.\u00a0<strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0uses a proprietary and patent-pending thread &amp; bliplock system to ensure secure physical engagement of a new tooth with its recess after replacement.\u00a0Replacement teeth and a custom T-head tool which also works with our mounting pins will soon be available on our website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0will nest with MAXTRAX MK2 recovery tracks, (although there is a slightly larger space between the tracks due to the design of the underside of the\u00a0<strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>).<\/li>\n<li>Mounting pins designed exclusively for the\u00a0<strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0are\u00a0available, including a hybrid mounting pin designed for those adding a set of\u00a0<strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0to the top of their current MKII recovery tracks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MAXTRAX XTREME<\/strong>\u00a0is also compatible with MAXTRAX mini and our fixing and linking kit to create a portable roadway.\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Australian designed, engineered and manufactured<\/li>\n<li>88 replaceable anodised alloy teeth; designed for XTREME users<\/li>\n<li>Safe and easy recovery from sand, mud, snow and slush<\/li>\n<li>Made from super tough engineering grade reinforced Nylon<\/li>\n<li>Compatible with MAXTRAX MKII and MAXTRAX mini<\/li>\n<li>Proven, patent-pending, multi-award-winning design<\/li>\n<li>Weight: 9kg\/20lbs per pair<\/li>\n<li>Six glove-friendly handles<\/li>\n<li>Lifetime warranty<\/li>\n<li>A variety of mounting and carrying options are available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Colour:<\/strong>\u00a0Stealth Black\u00a0<strong>Please note:<\/strong>\u00a0Actual colour may vary slightly from images shown.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Warranty:<\/strong>\u00a0We back our confidence in this quality Australian Made product with a lifetime warranty against faulty materials and workmanship.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shipping:<\/strong>\u00a0Please provide a physical address as we CANNOT ship to Post Office Boxes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Australian orders:<\/strong>\u00a0Shipping cost is automatically calculated when ordering.<br \/>\n<strong>International orders:<\/strong>\u00a0Shipping cost is manually calculated once your order is received.
