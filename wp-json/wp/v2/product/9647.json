This means that when pressure is applied to the accelerator pedal, it is measured by a sensor which sends the signal to the engine, opening the throttle. The time taken to achieve this is the lag you feel when you accelerate.<\/p>\n<div class=\"content-grid__col a-fade-in-up a-delay--2\">\n<div class=\"text-area\">\n<h3><strong>Throttle lag fixed<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Pedal Torq sits between the sensor and the ECU, intercepting the signal to shorten and improve the response time. The Pedal Torq reduces the amount of pedal pressure required to achieve \u2018wide open throttle\u2019, allowing the driver to access the engine\u2019s full potential.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-grid__col a-fade-in-up a-delay--3\">\n<div class=\"text-area\">\n<h3><strong>Real life scenario<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re first in the queue at the traffic lights and you accelerate when you see the green light but nothing happens for a second or two, this delayed throttle response is what is referred to as throttle lag. A Torqit Pedal Torq removes this lag, so the second you accelerate you are beginning to gain momentum.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<div class=\"featured-list__text a-fade-in-left\">\n<h3>Throttle Controller Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>The following benefits are provided by both the Pedal Torq and the Pedal Torq Plus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"featured-list__col\">\n<ul class=\"featured-list__items\">\n<li class=\"a-fade-in-left a-delay--1\" data-number=\"1\">1\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Increased throttle response:<\/strong> The vehicle is faster off the mark, feeling like it has had a full power upgrade.
